    replicas: 3
    resources:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "512Mi"
  
  project-service:
    replicas: 5  # Higher load service
    resources:
      cpu: "1000m"
      memory: "1Gi"
  
  ai-service:
    replicas: 2  # Resource intensive
    resources:
      cpu: "2000m"
      memory: "4Gi"
```

# Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: vibely-api-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: vibely-api
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 20
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```

### Database Scalability

**1. PostgreSQL Scaling Strategy**
- **Read Replicas**: Multiple read-only replicas for query distribution
- **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer with 100-500 connections per pool
- **Partitioning**: Table partitioning for large datasets (audit logs, time series)
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimized indexes for frequent queries

```sql
-- Example partitioning for audit logs
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    user_id UUID,
    action VARCHAR(100),
    details JSONB
) PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp);

-- Monthly partitions
CREATE TABLE audit_logs_2024_01 PARTITION OF audit_logs
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');
```

**2. Caching Strategy**
- **Redis Cluster**: 3-6 nodes with automatic failover
- **Multi-level Caching**: L1 (application), L2 (Redis), L3 (CDN)
- **Cache Invalidation**: Event-driven cache invalidation

```typescript
// Caching layers
interface CacheStrategy {
  userSessions: {
    ttl: '15 minutes'
    storage: 'Redis'
    pattern: 'user:session:{userId}'
  }
  projectData: {
    ttl: '5 minutes'
    storage: 'Redis + Application Memory'
    invalidation: 'event-driven'
  }
  searchResults: {
    ttl: '2 minutes'
    storage: 'Redis'
    compression: true
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

**1. Database Performance**

- **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **Field Selection**: GraphQL-style field selection for REST APIs
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk operations for data modifications

```typescript
// Optimized API response structure
interface OptimizedResponse<T> {
  data: T[]
  pagination: {
    cursor: string
    hasMore: boolean
    total?: number
  }
  meta: {
    responseTime: number
    cacheHit: boolean
  }
}
```

### Real-time Scalability

**1. WebSocket Scaling**
- **Socket.IO Clustering**: Redis adapter for multi-instance support
- **Room Management**: Efficient room-based message distribution

  adapter: createAdapter(redisClient, redisClient.duplicate()),
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling'],
  pingTimeout: 60000,
  pingInterval: 25000
});
```

**2. Notification Scaling**
- **Queue System**: Bull Queue with Redis for job processing
- **Batch Processing**: Batch email notifications to reduce load
- **Priority Queues**: High/medium/low priority notification processing

### File Storage Scalability

**1. MinIO Distributed Setup**
```yaml
# MinIO distributed mode (4 nodes minimum)
version: '3.8'
services:
  minio1:
    image: minio/minio
    command: server http://minio{1...4}/data
    environment:
      MINIO_ROOT_USER: admin
      MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - minio1-data:/data

  minio2:
    image: minio/minio
    command: server http://minio{1...4}/data
    volumes:
      - minio2-data:/data
```

**2. CDN Integration**
- **CloudFlare/AWS CloudFront**: Static asset delivery
- **Image Optimization**: On-the-fly image resizing and compression
- **Geographic Distribution**: Multi-region file storage

### Search Scalability

**1. Elasticsearch Cluster**
```yaml
# Elasticsearch cluster configuration
cluster.name: vibely-search
node.name: es-node-1
network.host: 0.0.0.0
discovery.seed_hosts: ["es-node-1", "es-node-2", "es-node-3"]
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["es-node-1", "es-node-2", "es-node-3"]

# Index settings for scalability
index.number_of_shards: 3
index.number_of_replicas: 1
index.refresh_interval: 30s
```

**2. Search Optimization**
- **Index Sharding**: Distribute indexes across multiple nodes
- **Search Result Caching**: Cache frequent search queries
- **Async Indexing**: Background indexing to avoid blocking operations

### Monitoring & Observability

**1. Performance Monitoring**
```yaml
# Prometheus metrics collection
metrics:
  - name: http_requests_total
    help: Total HTTP requests
    labels: [method, endpoint, status]
  
  - name: database_connections_active
    help: Active database connections
    
  - name: cache_hit_ratio
    help: Cache hit ratio percentage
```

**2. Auto-scaling Triggers**
- **CPU Usage**: Scale when CPU > 70% for 5 minutes
- **Memory Usage**: Scale when memory > 80% for 3 minutes
- **Response Time**: Scale when avg response time > 500ms
- **Queue Length**: Scale when job queue > 1000 items

### Capacity Planning

**1. Resource Allocation per 1000 Users**
```yaml
resources_per_1000_users:
  api_services:
    cpu: "2 cores"
    memory: "4GB"
    instances: 3
  
  database:
    cpu: "4 cores"
    memory: "8GB"
    storage: "100GB SSD"
    connections: 200
  
  cache:
    memory: "2GB"
    instances: 2
  
  file_storage:
    storage: "500GB"
    bandwidth: "100MB/s"
```

**2. Growth Projections**
- **10K Users**: 10-15 service instances, 3-node DB cluster
- **50K Users**: 50-75 service instances, 5-node DB cluster with read replicas
- **100K+ Users**: Multi-region deployment, database sharding

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Follow test-driven development (TDD) for all new features
- Implement features incrementally with working software at each step
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout of new capabilities
- Maintain backward compatibility during API evolution

### Quality Gates
- All code must pass automated tests before merge
- Code review required for all changes
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained
- Security scans must pass before deployment

### Dependencies and Sequencing
- Tasks 1-2 must be completed before any other work can begin
- AI features (Task 7) can be developed in parallel with other features
- Mobile app development (Task 11) can start after API stabilization (Task 9)
- Performance optimization (Task 12) should be ongoing throughout development

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building Vibely as a comprehensive collaboration platform, ensuring each component is properly tested and integrated while maintaining system quality and performance throughout the development process.
