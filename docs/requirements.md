# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes the core Vibely platform that combines project management (JIRA-like) and knowledge management (Confluence-like) capabilities within a unified workspace system. It provides secure user authentication, hierarchical role-based access control, flexible workspace types (organization, team, and individual), agile project management with complete ticket hierarchy, and collaborative wiki documentation.

### Role Hierarchy and Responsibilities

The system implements a six-tier role hierarchy where users have one primary role and can have multiple secondary roles at the same level or lower:

**1. Admin (Highest Level - IT/System Administrator)**

- **Capabilities**: 
  - System configuration and settings management
  - User account creation/deletion and role assignments
  - Workspace creation and technical configuration
  - CSV bulk import/export operations
  - System health monitoring and performance metrics
  - Backup/restore operations and disaster recovery
  - Security settings and audit log management
  - Database maintenance and optimization
  - Integration configuration (SSO, Git, webhooks)
  - System updates and maintenance windows
- **Secondary Roles**: Can have any secondary roles for testing/support purposes

**2. Project Manager (Second Level)**
- **Responsibilities**: Complete project oversight, sprint planning, team management, backlog prioritization, release planning, stakeholder communication
- **Capabilities**: Create/modify all ticket types, assign work to team members, manage sprints, access all project metrics and reports
- **Secondary Roles**: Can also have Technical Lead, Developer, and/or Tester/Reviewer roles

**3. Technical Lead (Third Level)**
- **Responsibilities**: Technical architecture decisions, code review oversight, technical mentoring, development standards enforcement, technical risk assessment
- **Capabilities**: Create/modify technical tickets (Features, Stories, Tasks), approve technical designs, assign technical work, review code quality
- **Secondary Roles**: Can also have Developer and/or Tester/Reviewer roles (but not Project Manager)

**4. Developer (Fourth Level)**  
- **Responsibilities**: Code development, technical implementation, unit testing, development task estimation, peer code reviews
- **Capabilities**: Create/modify development tickets (Tasks, SubTasks), update development status, perform code reviews
- **Secondary Roles**: Can also have Tester/Reviewer role (but not Project Manager or Technical Lead)

**5. Tester/Reviewer (Fifth Level)**
- **Responsibilities**: Quality assurance, acceptance criteria validation, testing, bug reporting, test case creation
- **Capabilities**: Create/modify bugs and testing tasks, update testing status, validate acceptance criteria
- **Secondary Roles**: Cannot have higher-level roles as secondary

**6. Guest (Lowest Level)**
- **Responsibilities**: Limited access for external stakeholders, view-only access to assigned content
- **Capabilities**: View-only permissions with admin-defined restrictions, cannot create or modify content
- **Secondary Roles**: Cannot have any secondary roles

### System Features

This integrated system enables teams to manage complete agile project lifecycles and documentation in one place while maintaining proper access controls, Git integration for development workflow tracking, and comprehensive audit trails for security and compliance. It also have GitHub and/or GitLab integration for proper tracking of development, testiing and validation.
